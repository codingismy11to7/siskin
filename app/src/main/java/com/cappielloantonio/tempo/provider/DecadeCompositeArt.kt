/**
 * Builds and caches the 2x2 cover mosaic behind a decade row.
 *
 * Plex has no composite for a filter value -- measured against PMS 1.43.3, the
 * decade index returns Directory entries with no thumb, composite or art;
 * `/library/sections/{key}/decade/{decade}/composite` 404s; and
 * `/library/sections/{key}/composite/1` is a section-wide mosaic identical for
 * every decade. So the tiling is ours.
 *
 * Kotlin rather than a method on AlbumArtContentProvider because LibraryClient
 * exposes suspend functions and that provider is Java -- the same wall
 * PlexScrobbler exists to cross for MediaManager.java. It also puts the whole
 * feature behind one seam a test can drive without standing up a ContentProvider.
